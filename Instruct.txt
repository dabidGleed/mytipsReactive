Assuming that you have Node installed, you can use npm to install the create-react-native-app command line utility:
npm install -g create-react-native-app

Then run the following commands to create a new React Native project called "AwesomeProject":
create-react-native-app AwesomeProject

cd AwesomeProject
npm start

This will start a development server for you, and print a QR code in your terminal

// install EXP
npm install -g exp

// build for versions
exp start 

// build apk 
exp build:android
